A simple Python version of the 3x + 1 math problem wherein any whole number that is odd is multiplied by 3 and then has one added to it, any any even number is divided by 2, will always eventually end up at 1, where it is then stuck in a loop of 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, ect.

In the intrest of not creating an infinate loop this script ends the first time the script hits 1
